# Incorrect State Update in React

This repository demonstrates a common error in React: directly modifying the state variable instead of using the setter function.  The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect approach which fails to update the UI.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the correct solution.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if any).
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
